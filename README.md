# DataWhizEngineer Project

This repository contains a machine learning project that uses a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict sentiment from IMDB movie reviews. The model is built using TensorFlow/Keras, and the application runs in a Python environment with the necessary dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Project Structure

- **app.py**: The main application file that runs the model and provides an interface for predictions.
- **imdb_rnn_model.h5**: Pre-trained RNN model for sentiment analysis on IMDB movie reviews.
- **Experiment.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook used for experimenting with the RNN model.
- **prediction.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook to make predictions using the trained RNN model.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the Python dependencies required to run the project.
- **.devcontainer**: Configuration files for running the project in a dev container.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DataWhizEngineer/SimpleRNN_IMDB
   
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd DataWhizEngineer

4. **Install the Required Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
  
6. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
